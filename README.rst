### Googletrans language list update

ORIGINAL REPOSITORY: https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans

This humble fork of the brilliantly convenient Googletrans is intended to solve a trivial task of adding a bunch of new languages to the list. As the original has only been sporadically updated since 2020, it's missing out on a lot of those.

This repo is highly likely to eventually be outdated and become redundant since the author of the original announced a new version of the library. It is made only for my conveniece as at the moment I am working on an amateur linguistic study that requires quick access to translating certain words to as many languages as possible. 

All who are interested are welcome to use and contribute to this fork.
